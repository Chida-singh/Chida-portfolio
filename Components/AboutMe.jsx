            <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
            <p>
              I'm Chidananda, a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. 
              I specialize in creating interactive web applications with clean, efficient code and 
              intuitive user experiences.
            </p>
            
            <h3>MY JOURNEY</h3>
            <p>
              My journey in programming began with a love for problem-solving and creative design. 
              I've honed my skills through academic studies in Computer Science and hands-on project work, 
              constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies.
            </p>
            
            <h3>WHAT I DO</h3>
            <p>
              I build responsive web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, 
              along with backend technologies like Node.js and Firebase. I focus on creating 
              applications that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
            </p>
            
            <h3>WHEN NOT CODING</h3>
            <p>
              When I'm not writing code, you might find me playing Minecraft (obviously!), 
              exploring new tech, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm passionate about 
              continuous learning and staying at the forefront of web development trends.
